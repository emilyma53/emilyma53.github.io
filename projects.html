							<br> <br>
							<p>I worked in a group to create a simulation of jellyfish movement underwater as part of a final project for CS184: Foundation of Computer Graphics. 
								Our project was to render an animated simulation of jellyfish movement in water based on a cloth simulation approximation. For our jellyfish cloth, 
								we wrote a translucency shader featuring silhouette enhancement. Through triangle sorting and interpolated alpha blending, we achieved a 
								semi-transparent jellyfish through which the ocean background is visible. For the jellyfish model, we created a spring-mass frame consisting of 
								point masses and structural, shearing, and bending springs. Force vectors on the spring-mass model simulate jellyfish muscle contraction and 
								modified gravitational forces simulate water buoyancy.

								Inspired by the forest fire seasons in California, I simulated how fire spreads through forests. 
								This simulation uses the idea of cellular automata as each cell in the 2D image has four possible states: 
								vegetation (green), empty land (brown), burning (orange), and burnt (gray). At each time step, the 
								simulation uses three probabilities: density of vegetation, chance of ignition, and chance of becoming burnt 
								to determine the next state for each cell in the forest. These probabilities would be different for each forest 
								based on the humidity, type of forest vegetation, etc.. The simulation follows the ideas discussed in 
								"Rodolfo Maduro Almeida and Elbert E N Macau 2011 J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 285 012038 https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/285/1/012038/pdf".

							<p> 
								Glade of the Gray is a deck-based dungeon crawler where the player’s party of misfits 
								will battle to complete quests. Each member of the party will have their own deck of 
								unique skills they can use in battle. By traversing the dungeon, the user can pick up 
								items, interact with change fortunes, and encounter enemies. 

								For this game, I worked with a team to create this in Unity. I coded the logic for dungeon traversals 
								by randomizing enemies, items, and creating dungeon maps. I also created interactables such as fortune tellers, 
								slot machines, and item chests for the dungeon.

								I processed simulation data of the atmosphere's of Jupiter and Uranus. I ran many experiments 
								with different parameters such as cooling rates and simulation grid size to converge on realistic conditions. Additionally, I created plots 
								and videos to analyze the atmospheric simulations and compare the outputs to expected behavior. 
								These plots observed pressure, temperature, velocity, potential temperature, and more over time. Above 
								is an example video of the horizontal velocity of Uranus atmosphere over time.

							<p> 
								I animated this 3D short along with three other teammates. The concept for the story is 
								a water droplet comes to life after a rainstorm. The droplet is fascinated by the nearby waterfall 
								and wants to go into the waterfall. Through the phases of the water cycle, the droplet fulfills 
								its dream as it rains into the waterfall pond. 
								This short was created using Maya 3D animation software. I modeled the cloud, rocks, and 
								many of the background objects such as the flowers and pond. I also did a lot of the lighting and animation.

							<a href="https://github.com/emilyma53/brown-dwarfs">Brown Dwarf Database Repository</a>
							<br> <br>
							<p>
								For a summer research project, I compiled a database of brown dwarfs likely to observe 
								polarization. I researched characteristics that would allow for high quantities of 
								polarization. Some variables I looked for were high rotational velocity, low surface 
								gravity, and young age. I looked through past research findings for brown dwarf 
								polarization candidates. I also wrote functions to query large astronomy databases such 
								as Simbad to fill in missing characteristics and filter for more candidates.

							<a href="https://github.com/emilyma53/chess">Chess Repository</a>
							<br> <br>
							<p>
								Game of chess that follows the usual rules. I created an in-terminal chess game 
								that two players can compete against each other. The game will prompt the player 
								to enter a move and only accepts valid moves given the piece type and current player. The chess game 
								will also calculate each player's total points and captured pieces so far. This was created 
								in Python for fun.

							<br> <br>
							<p>
								Move and jump to dodge the farm animals charging towards you! The longer you survive, the higher your score will be. 
								You can also collect coins to increase your score. This game was created in a pair as part of the Game Design and Development course.
								Everything was made in Unity.
